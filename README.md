Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version - 2.7.3

- Rails version - 6.1.4

- Deployment instructions

Clone the git repo to you local machine.

You will need the correct versions of ruby and rails to run the app.

I recommend using RVM https://rvm.io/rvm/install

Once installed run the following commands:

rvm install ruby 2.7.3

rvm use 2.7.3

gem install rails 6.1.4

Then bundle install.

You should be able to start the server by running the 'rails s' command
